    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: This post contains <em>major</em> spoilers to the entire series of Agatha All Along. I suggest you go watch it first.</p>

</aside>

Agatha All Along had just aired its series finale, and girl—what a wild ride! First of all I loved the series. It's one of the series I enjoyed the most and I will probably come back to it multiple times in the future. Jac Schaeffer, the creator of the series and WandaVision before it, has taken such great care over every character in this show. With two shows in her roster, I believe the witch and magick side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (<abbr>MCU</abbr>) is in good hands.

However, while they weren't the worst, the two-part finale of Agatha All Along has been quite a bit confusing. And I'm not talking about the very wild concepts they were introducing into this universe. They were very tastefully done without too much exposition, witchababble, and nerd talk as the folks in the sci-fi scene tend to do (which the Multiverse Saga is also very guilty of). Rather, the problems lie in the pacing and scene arrangement of the last two episodes.

## Was it the finale? Or was that an epilogue?

After my first watch, I felt really lost as to what the entire point of the Witches' Road was. I was also confused but I couldn't figure out what it was. It was after a few go arounds that I realized something: Episode 8 was the finale, and Episode 9 was the epilogue. When I started looking at them that way, I appreciated the finale more. Because of how it was presented, the finale felt underwhelming. Episode 8 ends with Billy realizing he created the Witches' Road. As the viewer, you'd think there's more to it so you very excitedly click Next Episode. Then we start a montage of Agatha's history and the true nature of the Ballad and the Witches' Road. Then after that, there was very little plot movement, which I guess is okay. It was the last episode after all, and they were just trying to tie some loose ends. But on the first viewing, it doesn't feel like the grand finale Agatha deserved. In reality, it felt like a 30-minute post-credits scene.

And this problem was in WandaVision as well. The moment the plot moved away from the show's main narrative tool and gimmick, the plot fell flat. The moment the true nature of the Hex was revealed, the plot immediately became a generic Marvel action film. The hero and the villain blasting each other off with their powers. And I am not saying it was bad, because WandaVision's finale was so beautifully done and tied with a bow. But it didn't feel as big as it could've been. Agatha All Along had the exact same problem. The moment we left the Witches' Road, the plot started becoming a little bit flat. It wasn't as drastic of a change as in WandaVision, but it was enough to be noticeable. And even then, that wasn't a problem as big as the pacing of the final two episodes.

## A suggestion.

So how might we rearrange the last two episodes so it feels more climactic and not underwhelming? I have a few notes. Let's start at episode 8.

### Episode 8: The Final Trial

We turn to the Witches' Road and Jen and Billy still couldn't believe that Lilia had just sacrificed herself to take down the Salem Seven. Everything proceeds as is, as the first half of this episode was perfect as it is. Then we take a pause right about the middle when Billy finally gets out of the road, leaving Agatha in the final trial alone. For a few moments, we see her ready to accept her end. She takes her pendant out and kisses the hair inside it. This is where we make the first cut.

We splice in Agatha's flashback that happens in the first half of Episode 9. This scene is the perfect moment to finally reveal her past and what actually happened to Nicholas Scratch. The flashback scenes play as is, until Nicholas' funeral just as soon as Agatha finishes her addendum to the Ballad. 

Later on, we find out that Agatha does not want to die, at least not yet, because she isn't ready to face Nicholas yet. And by transposing this scene into the moment in the final trial where Agatha is starting to accept the possibility of her dying on the Road, we put a lore dump into an important and emotionally charged scene. This is as opposed to what was in the final cut, where the entire flashback scene is in the first half of the final episode, with nothing to trigger it, no reason for it to show up other than there's nothing else to show and the audience are still asking some questions.

We cut back to Agatha in the final trial. She puts back the hair into the pendant, when she realizes there's a single dandelion seed in it. <q>Out of death, life…</q> She proceeds to plant it and water it with her tears. She appears to have run out of time, but just as the time runs out, the seed sprouts. And *then*, the episode ends. We no longer see the trial's facility break down, nor do we see Agatha trying desperately to open the door out. The seed sprouting is understood to be a sign of Agatha passing the final trial.

### Episode 9: The Climax

We begin episode 9 immediately where we left off. Agatha bursts out of the Bohner basement, realizes her <i>prize</i>, that is, her powers, haven't been given to her yet even when she had finished the final trial. The Rio vs. Agatha fight happens; Billy comes to Agatha's rescue and gives her some of his powers. Agatha tricks Billy into volunteering to come with Lady Death, only to turn back from it and sacrifice herself dying for good. Billy returns to his home, where he finally realizes that he created the Witches' Road. <q>It was me.</q> Then cut. We transition into the second half of the Agatha flashbacks.

After finishing her addendum to the Ballad, a witch comes to Agatha for help to open the Witches' Road. We finish the flashback, then we cut back to Billy in his room. The ghost of Agatha laughs maniacally. <q>Boo!</q> she says, startling Billy. Then the rest of the episode plays as is.

## What happens now?

The series ends with Agatha's ghost taking Billy on a new journey to find his twin brother Tommy. This, to me, is very clear indication of them building up a story that will lead into the Scarlet Witch solo movie. That is also very wild to me, considering Marvel had all this stuff in mind for the Multiverse Saga, only for the audience to crave more Wanda Maximoff, witchcraft, and lesbians. And I, for one, am very excited.
