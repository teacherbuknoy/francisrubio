My Issy single pressed shadow came today and I immediately tried to review them. They're very cheap at ₱ 149.00 each. Compared to a full 21-color palette that I bought for about ₱ 900 at a mall, the singles are quite expensive. But if you're only looking for a single color that's missing from your palette (in my case, a white shadow), this item can be worth it.

I was kind of disappointed with this product at first to be honest. When I ordered this, I thought they were cream shadows. But immediately while opening the packaging, I saw that they were powder. I was kind of looking forward to using cream shadows for the first time.

But they turned out to be quite nice, actually. I swatched them on my hand and they were pigmented enough for me, especially the shades Russet (the brown one) and Rosebud (the burgundy one).

One thing I'm kind of sad, though, is the amount of fallout from the shade Phantom (the black one) and the lack of pigment from the shade Blanc (the white one). These are the reason I even bought one of these in the first place, and I'm kind of disappointed. But for their price, they are good enough. I think it's hard to make the black and white pigments right, and it's probably better to get these two colors in cream form.
