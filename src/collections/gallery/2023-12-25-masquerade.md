    At the risk of pretentiousness, I attended this year’s DICE205 gala night in a look I’d consider to be more extravagant than what is normally acceptable at corporate events. Of course, I’ve always been fascinated about the idea of eccentricity, and I lamented how every man in fashion events look the same. I wanted to showcase what male fashion can be with just a little bit of imagination and pretentiousness.

    Throughout the year, I have built a colorway for my fashion. In my photos, I have made statements about queerness, femininity, and celebrations of diversity. This look closes the year with a hopefully resounding and celebratory look. This time, I wanted to do something that's more than just putting garments and accessories together and hope that they fit and they look good. I wanted my look to say something.

    Masquerades increased in popularity throughout the mainland Europe at around 18th to 19th century, around the same time as the first industrial revolution. For the uninitiated, industrial revolutions are turning point events when a human invention changes the trajectory of human history from that point forward. The invention of the steam engine resulted in a transition that led to the progress we have today. Unfortunately, it also marks the beginning of the climate crisis, the climax of which is being faced by society today.

    When assembling a look, I honor diversity and contrasts. Industrial revolutions call my mind to raw materials like iron, copper, bronze, alloy, and steam. I wanted to contrast such materials as well as human technological advancements with the gifts of nature. The most beautiful elements of art today are yet to surpass the creations of nature in their beauty, color, and sheer abundance. I knew I wanted flowers to come into play with this look.

    This look went through a lot of refinements. In the original idea, I wanted my mask to look like copper or bronze, and I wanted it to look rusted and reclaimed by nature, with roots, veins, and flowers growing in, through, and around it. To me, it was a poignant visual that evokes the sheer power of nature and time, of which our inventions, as polluting and destructive they may be, will never surpass. 

    Eventually however, due to material constraints, I opted to wear a mask decorated with a bouquet of flowers. In this iteration, I wanted to wear a mask that looked like a garden gifted by God himself to humanity, reminiscent of the original Garden of Eden. In my mind, not necessarily communicated by the design, this bouquet hearkens back to every gift of beauty bestowed upon our world that is always met by desolate ruination—humans destroying nature. In this design, either nature has preserved its purity and has yet to receive the lashes of humanity's progress, or nature has conquered that which humans couldn't: time.

    I consider this look to be an amalgamation of previous looks I’ve had, and an infusion of my personal identity. I wanted to emanate an aura of eccentricity, a feeling of being unattainable to the common folk, almost goddess-like. Instead of appearing as a sculpture of bronze abandoned by society and reclaimed by nature (obviously as a symbol of queerness) like the initial idea I came up with, I wanted to appear as an avatar of nature walking through the business district, with onlookers from all castes, lineages, degrees, and status left in sheer awe and a feeling of unworthiness—a feeling of remorseful appreciation for nature’s beauty (as, of course, another allegory for queerness).

    Characterized by corsets, an oversized coat, and a pair of high-heeled boots, I came to the runway walking not as myself but as a representative to the council of the gods, an ultimate deciding entity about the fate of humanity, and a harbinger, negotiator for the welfare of world creations, appealing to the human society for their own sake.
